# FinTech Cybersecurity Risk Assessment – PayWave

## 1. Business Overview
PayWave is a FinTech company that provides digital wallet and payment
processing services for retail customers and small merchants across
the European Union. The platform enables users to store funds, make
peer-to-peer payments, and process merchant transactions through web
and mobile applications. PayWave generates revenue primarily through
transaction-based fees.

## 2. Core Business Functions
- Customer onboarding and identity verification (KYC)
- Digital wallet and balance management
- Payment processing and transaction authorization
- Merchant payment settlement
- API integrations with banks and third-party services

## 3. Critical Assets

### Information Assets
- Customer personal data (PII)
- Financial transaction records
- Authentication credentials
- API keys and cryptographic secrets

### Technical Assets
- Web and mobile applications
- Backend payment processing services
- Cloud infrastructure hosted on AWS
- Databases storing customer and transaction data

### Business Assets
- Company reputation and customer trust
- Regulatory compliance status (GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- Revenue generated from transaction fees
- Relationships with customers, merchants, and partners

## 4. High-Level System Architecture
Users access the PayWave platform through web and mobile applications.
Requests are routed through API gateways to backend microservices
hosted on cloud infrastructure. Customer and transaction data are
stored in managed databases, while third-party banking APIs are used
for payment settlement and verification.

## 5. Business Impact Dependencies
- Downtime in the payment processing system directly impacts revenue.
- Exposure of customer data may result in regulatory penalties and
  reputational damage.
- Compromise of APIs could lead to fraudulent transactions and
  financial losses.
- Service outages may result in SLA breaches with merchants and
  partners.

  ## Risk Assessment Methodology

This project follows a structured cybersecurity risk assessment
approach aligned with industry practices used in FinTech and GRC
roles.

### Risk Identification
Critical assets were identified across information, technical, and
business domains. Threats were mapped to these assets using realistic
FinTech threat scenarios, including external attacks and insider
risks.

### Risk Scoring
Each risk was assessed using a qualitative risk scoring model:
- Likelihood scored on a scale of 1 (Low) to 5 (High)
- Impact scored on a scale of 1 (Low) to 5 (High)
- Risk Score calculated as: Likelihood × Impact

Risk levels were categorised as:
- Low (1–5)
- Medium (6–12)
- High (15–25)

### Risk Visualisation
A risk heat map was created to visually represent the relationship
between likelihood and impact, supporting prioritisation of risks for
mitigation.

### Framework Alignment
Identified risks were mapped to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques to
demonstrate alignment with recognised threat modelling frameworks.
## Third-Party / Vendor Risk Assessment

In addition to internal cybersecurity risks, a third-party risk
assessment was conducted for a critical payment processing vendor
(CloudPay Services).

The assessment includes:
- Vendor profiling and criticality analysis
- Identification of key vendor-related cyber, operational, and
  compliance risks
- Qualitative risk scoring and ownership assignment
- Vendor due diligence checklist focused on security, compliance,
  and business continuity controls

This reflects how third-party risk is managed in FinTech and
regulated environments where vendor dependencies introduce
significant operational and regulatory exposure.
